<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Separator for Sodium-ion Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Separator</li><li>Wet Separator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A dry separator is a type of separator for sodium-ion batteries that does not contain any liquid electrolyte. It offers high stability and efficiency but may have limitations in terms of energy density. On the other hand, a wet separator uses a liquid electrolyte which allows for higher energy density but may be prone to leakage and less stable performance. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application requirements of the sodium-ion battery system.</p></p>
