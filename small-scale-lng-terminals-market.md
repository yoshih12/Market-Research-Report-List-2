<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminals</li><li>Regasification Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small Scale LNG Terminals can be classified into two main types: Liquefaction Terminals and Regasification Terminals. Liquefaction Terminals are facilities that convert natural gas into LNG by cooling it to a liquid state, making it easier to transport and store. On the other hand, Regasification Terminals receive LNG and convert it back into natural gas through a process that involves heating the LNG and vaporizing it. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the small scale LNG market by facilitating the transportation and distribution of LNG.</p></p>
