<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-blown IGCC</li><li>Oxygen-blown IGCC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plants are a type of power generation technology that converts coal into gas, removes impurities, and burns the gas in a gas turbine to generate electricity, capturing waste heat to produce steam for additional power generation. There are two main types of IGCC plants: Air-blown IGCC, which uses air as the gasification agent, and Oxygen-blown IGCC, which uses pure oxygen. Air-blown IGCC plants are more common due to lower capital costs, while Oxygen-blown IGCC plants offer higher efficiency and lower emissions.</p></p>
