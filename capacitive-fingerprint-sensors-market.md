<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Fingerprint Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Area</li><li>Swipe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive fingerprint sensors are available in two main types - area and swipe sensors. Area sensors are stationary sensors that capture an image of the fingerprint by placing the finger on a defined area on the sensor. Swipe sensors, on the other hand, require the user to swipe their finger across the sensor for it to capture an image. Both types offer secure and convenient biometric authentication for various applications such as smartphones, laptops, access control systems, and payment devices.</p></p>
