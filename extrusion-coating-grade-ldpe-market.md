<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extrusion Coating Grade LDPE Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Process</li><li>Autoclave Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extrusion coating grade LDPE is used in two main processes in the market: the tubular process and the autoclave process. In the tubular process, LDPE resin is melted and extruded through a circular die, forming a tube that is inflated with air to create a bubble. This bubble is collapsed and flattened into a thin film. In the autoclave process, LDPE is melted and pressurized in an autoclave reactor before being extruded through a die to create a film. Both processes are widely used in the packaging industry for various applications.</p></p>
