<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Water Turbines</li><li>Reactive Water Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water turbines can be categorized into two main types based on their working principle: Impulse water turbines and Reactive water turbines. Impulse water turbines work based on the kinetic energy of the water stream, utilizing the pressure difference created by the flow to generate power. On the other hand, Reactive water turbines operate by using both the kinetic energy and the pressure of the water stream to produce electricity. Both types play a crucial role in the renewable energy sector by harnessing the power of flowing water to generate clean and sustainable electricity.</p></p>
