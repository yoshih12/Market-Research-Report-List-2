<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet</li><li>Liquid Applied</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastomeric membrane market consists of two main types: sheet and liquid applied membranes. Sheet membranes are pre-formed rolls or sheets made of elastomeric materials that are fastened to the substrate using adhesives or mechanical fasteners. On the other hand, liquid applied membranes are applied as liquids that cure into a seamless membrane upon drying. Both types offer waterproofing and protective coatings for various structures, such as roofs, decks, and foundations, with each type having its own unique advantages and applications.</p></p>
