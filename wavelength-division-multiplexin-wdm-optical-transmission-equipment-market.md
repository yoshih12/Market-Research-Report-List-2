<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Division Multiplexin WDM Optical Transmission Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexin (CWDM)</li><li>Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing ( DWDM)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology that allows multiple optical signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of light. There are two main types of WDM: Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). CWDM typically uses wider spacing between wavelengths, allowing for fewer channels to be transmitted over the same fiber. DWDM, on the other hand, uses closer spacing between wavelengths, enabling more channels to be transmitted, resulting in higher data capacity.</p></p>
