<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Plywood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UCFA</li><li>UCFB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire retardant plywood is classified into two main types: UCFA (Untreated Class A Fire) and UCFB (Untreated Class B Fire). UCFA plywood is designed for use in areas where the risk of fire is high, with a higher resistance to fire and better protective qualities. UCFB plywood is suitable for areas with a lower fire risk, offering good fire resistance but not as high as UCFA plywood. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safety and minimizing damage in case of a fire outbreak.</p></p>
