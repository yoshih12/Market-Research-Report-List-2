<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Sonobuoy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wried Sonobuoy</li><li>Wireless Sonobuoy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active sonobuoys are used for anti-submarine warfare and underwater surveillance. Wired sonobuoys use a physical cable to transmit acoustic data to the deploying aircraft or ship. Wireless sonobuoys, on the other hand, use radio frequencies to transmit the data wirelessly. Wired sonobuoys are more reliable in terms of data transmission but have limited range due to the cable. Wireless sonobuoys offer greater flexibility and can cover larger areas but may be prone to interference. Both types play a crucial role in underwater detection and tracking operations.</p></p>
