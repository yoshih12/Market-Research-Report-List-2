<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent borne</li><li>Waterborne</li><li>Powder-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy coatings are available in various types including solvent borne, waterborne, and powder-based options. Solvent borne epoxy coatings contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and require the use of solvent for application. Waterborne epoxy coatings, on the other hand, use water as a carrier for the epoxy resins, making them more environmentally friendly. Powder-based epoxy coatings are applied as a dry powder and then heat-cured to form a tough protective film. Each type of epoxy coating offers different benefits and is suitable for various applications.</p></p>
