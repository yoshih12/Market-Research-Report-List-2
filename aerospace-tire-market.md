<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerospace tires are classified into two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have reinforcing belts that run perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better stability and traction. They are commonly used in commercial aircraft due to their durability and fuel efficiency. Bias tires, on the other hand, have cords that run diagonally across the tire, making them more flexible and easier to maneuver. These tires are often found in smaller aircraft and military applications due to their ability to handle heavier loads and rough terrain.</p></p>
