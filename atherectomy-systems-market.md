<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atherectomy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Atherectomy</li><li>Orbital Atherectomy</li><li>Photo-Ablative (Laser) Atherectomy</li><li>Rotational Atherectomy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atherectomy systems are medical devices used to remove plaque from arteries in patients suffering from coronary artery disease. There are different types of atherectomy systems available, including directional atherectomy, orbital atherectomy, photo-ablative (laser) atherectomy, and rotational atherectomy. Directional atherectomy involves cutting and extracting plaque, while orbital atherectomy uses a rotating crown to sand away plaque. Photo-ablative atherectomy uses laser energy to vaporize plaque, and rotational atherectomy involves rotating a burr to shave off plaque from the artery walls.</p></p>
