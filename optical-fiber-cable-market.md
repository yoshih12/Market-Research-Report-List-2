<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fiber Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Optical Fiber Cable Market consists of two main types: Multimode Fiber and Single-mode Fiber. Multimode Fiber is suitable for short distances due to its larger core size, allowing multiple modes of light to propagate simultaneously. It is commonly used in LAN networks. On the other hand, Single-mode Fiber has a smaller core size, enabling light to travel in a single mode, making it ideal for long-distance communication. It is often used in telecommunication networks and data centers for high-speed and high-bandwidth applications.</p></p>
