<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Organic liquid photoresist is a light-sensitive material used in photolithography to transfer patterns onto surfaces. There are two main types of organic liquid photoresist: Positive and Negative. Positive photoresist becomes soluble in developer where it is exposed to light, allowing the desired pattern to remain. Negative photoresist becomes insoluble in developer where it is exposed to light, resulting in the desired pattern being removed. Both types play crucial roles in the electronics and semiconductor industries for creating intricate circuit patterns and designs.</p></p>
