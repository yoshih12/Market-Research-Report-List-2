<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building and Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Building and construction plastics market consists of two main types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics can be melted and remoulded multiple times without losing their properties, making them ideal for products like pipes, insulation, and windows. On the other hand, thermosetting plastics harden irreversibly after being heated, making them suitable for applications that require high temperature resistance, such as electrical components and composites. Both types of plastics play a significant role in the construction industry's materials and products.</p></p>
