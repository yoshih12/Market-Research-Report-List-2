<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plug Type</li><li>Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disc brake calipers are components of a braking system that apply pressure to the brake pads, which in turn clamp down on the brake rotor to slow or stop a vehicle. The market for disc brake calipers can be categorized into two main types: Plug type and Rotating type. Plug type calipers have a fixed design and are directly mounted to the vehicle, while Rotating type calipers have a floating design that allows them to move laterally as the brake pads wear down, resulting in more even wear and consistent braking performance.</p></p>
