<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Humidity Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Humidity Sensor</li><li>Absolute Humidity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial humidity sensors can be classified into two main types: relative humidity sensors and absolute humidity sensors. Relative humidity sensors measure the amount of moisture in the air relative to the maximum amount of moisture the air could hold at a given temperature. Absolute humidity sensors, on the other hand, measure the actual amount of water vapor present in the air. Both types of sensors are essential in various industries where precise control of humidity levels is critical for processes such as manufacturing, storage, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
